# nori.io#
nori.io is a one dimensional esolang that is interpreted in Scratch, although you're currently seeing nori.io# which is the version written in Lua

The iterpreter reads the program left-to-right, character per character, and always moves right.

## Commands
There are a bunch of commands in nori.io#, including event limited commands! Which will be coming in later versions

### Main commands
